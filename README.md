# ML-with-Multiple-Linear-Regression

Multiple linear regression(LR.py) is implemented without using library. 
Using this linear regression, I will train the model on the 500_Person_Gender_Height_Weight_Index dataset. Using this model, the BMI (Body Mass Index) value will be estimated by looking at a person's weight and height.
